# Strange behavior of CAP with PDF files

Clone the project, then ```npm install``` then ```cds deploy --to sqlite```

Use file [api.http](api.http) to create initial entities:

POST http://localhost:4004/demo/Directory with

```
{ "fileName": "Just a file", "fileDescription": "Just a description" }
```

Take the generated ID, then create a media resource:

POST http://localhost:4004/demo/Documents with

```
{ "mimeType": "application/pdf", "directory_ID": "<generated above>", "downloadName": "Test_PDF.pdf" }
```

MimeType is used by ```@Core.MediaType``` annotation.

DownloadName is used by ```@Core.ContentDisposition.Filename``` annotation.

Launch the LROP page and within the object page see the "not viewable" message from sap.m.PDFViewer.
Try to download the PDF via the link in the Object Page header and see the "empty" PDF.

Test via Postman:

http://localhost:4004/demo/Documents('--your--ID--here')/contents 

returns a perfectly viewable PDF.
